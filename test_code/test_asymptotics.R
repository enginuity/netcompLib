## Want to test the following asymptotics (for each method)

# how close to a chi-square distribution is the raw test statistic? how does this change as network size increases? -- can also increase the number of observed networks -- this is to only test to see if everything becomes really optimal. 

# does this still work when we take a random subset of edges? presumably... 

# maybe this requires a function that can compute the correct df given two models.
