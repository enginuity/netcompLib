netcomp_lib
===========

General Network Comparisons Functions

NOTE: Some of the code is from Andrew Thomas (code related to doing MCMC for HRGs in R)
NOTE: All the code herein will assume that the working directory is THIS base directory (where this README file resides). (This only applies to code that calls the scripts where the functions are defined directly)

-------------------------
Files in base directory: 
compile_package.R -- This R script will rebuild the package
load_library.R -- This script loads the netcompLib package and all packages it depends on
load_source.R -- This script loads the functions in the netcompLib package into the global directory (by running 'source' on the source code files), and also loads all packages it depends on

-------------------------
Directory Structure: 

netcompLib/ -- This folder contains all the functions (and source) for this package. The format is a standard R package. 

-------------------------
Documentation rules -- For parameter listings in function documentation: 
[<type>] :: <documentation>
, will separate information about parameters: eg. 
LEN = (length of vector) or 
DIM = (dimensions of matrix, etc.)
; will separate information about values the parameter takes on
DEFAULT = (default value) or
ALLOWED = (possibly a vector of allowed values)

Example: 
[vector-int, LEN = 2; DEFAULT = c(1,2)] :: some description
list, matrix, array, vector
int, double, char

For documentation of classes: (S3 classes)
