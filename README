NOTE: Some of the code is from Andrew Thomas (code related to doing MCMC for HRGs in R)
NOTE: All the code herein will assume that the working directory is THIS base directory (where this README file resides)

-------------------------
Files in base directory: 
compile_package.R -- This R script will rebuild the package
load_library.R -- This script loads the netcompLib package and dependency packages
load_source.R -- This script loads the functions in the netcompLib package into the global directory (by running 'source' on the source code files)

-------------------------
Directory Structure: 

netcompLib/ -- This folder contains all the functions (and source) for this package. The format is a standard R package.
